# Myers Briggs

This data looks at the relationship betweeen four binary variables.  The challenge is how to display that in one visualization.  My first idea was to use a mosaic plot.  However, I came across advice from "The Perceptual Edge", that generally advised against the use of the mosaic plot, instead favoring a kind of nested bar plot.  I tried to implement that.  While I do think that it is pretty, I think that it still requires a lot of the reader to interpret the graph.  Perhaps more annotation could alleviate this burden. 

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, echo = F}
data0 <- readxl::read_xlsx("raw_data/MyersBriggsTypes.xlsx")

data <- data0 %>%
  rename(
    EI = `(E)xtroversion/(I)ntroversion`,
    SI = `(S)ensing/I(N)tuition`,
    TF = `(T)hinking/(F)eeling`,
    JP = `(J)udging/(P)erceiving`
  ) %>%
  mutate(`Perthousand in Population` = 1000 * `Ratio in Population`)

`(E)xtroversion/(I)ntroversion` <- rep(data$EI, data$`Perthousand in Population`)
`(S)ensing/I(N)tuition` <- rep(data$SI, data$`Perthousand in Population`)
`(T)hinking/(F)eeling` <- rep(data$TF, data$`Perthousand in Population`)
`(J)udging/(P)erceiving` <- rep(data$JP, data$`Perthousand in Population`)
 

d <- data_frame(
  `(S)ensing/I(N)tuition`,
  `(T)hinking/(F)eeling`,
  `(J)udging/(P)erceiving`, `(E)xtroversion/(I)ntroversion`,
  count = 1
)

d <- d %>%
  mutate(
    `(E)xtroversion/(I)ntroversion` = recode(`(E)xtroversion/(I)ntroversion`, E = "Extroversion", I = "Introversion"),
    `(S)ensing/I(N)tuition` = recode(`(S)ensing/I(N)tuition`, S = "Sensing", N = "Intuition"),
    `(T)hinking/(F)eeling` = recode(`(T)hinking/(F)eeling`, T = "Thinking", F = "Feeling"),
    `(J)udging/(P)erceiving` = recode(`(J)udging/(P)erceiving`, J = "Judging", P = "Perceiving")
  )

background <- data_frame(mins = c(.5, 1.5), max = c(1.5, 2.5), `judging perceiving` = c(" Judging", " Perceiving"))


```

A random sample from the data set: 
```{r, echo = F}
knitr::kable(sample_n(d, 5))
```


```{r}
ggplot(d) +
  aes(x = `(J)udging/(P)erceiving`) +
  aes(fill = `(T)hinking/(F)eeling`) +
  facet_grid(`(E)xtroversion/(I)ntroversion` ~
               `(S)ensing/I(N)tuition`) +
  geom_rect(aes(x = NULL, y = NULL,
                xmin = mins, xmax = max, 
                fill = `judging perceiving`),
                ymin = 0, ymax = 700, data = background
  ) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c("lightgrey", "darkgrey", "blue", "violet"), c(.3, .3, .6, .6))) +
